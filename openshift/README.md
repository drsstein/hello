# Openshift

The IDA GPU cluster uses Openshift for container orchestration.

A common use case of the cluster is to run a jupyter notebook server, which requires a Deployment Config, a Service, and a Route configuration. The configuration files are unique to each user as they link to user projects and user storage. 

This repo contains my configuration files.
